## ðŸŽ¯ Testing Priorities (Ordered by Impact)

### High Priority (Must Test)
1. **API Endpoints** ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
   - [x] Projects GET endpoint (4/4 tests)
   - [ ] Projects POST endpoint (Request mocking issue)
   - [ ] Timeline CRUD operations
   - [ ] Flagged items management

2. **Authentication System** ðŸ“‹ NEXT

2. **Add Timeline API tests** - Extend integration test coverage
3. **Create component tests** - Start unit testing UI components

### Short Term (Next 2 Weeks)
1. **Authentication testing** - Test NextAuth integration
2. **Database testing** - Add Prisma operation tests
3. **E2E setup** - Configure Playwright for user journeys

### Medium Term (Next Month)
1. **CI/CD integration** - Add testing to deployment pipeline
2. **Performance testing** - Add load and performance tests
3. **Coverage improvement** - Reach 80%+ code coverage

---

## ðŸ”§ Known Issues & Solutions

### 1. NextRequest Mocking Issue
- **Problem**: Cannot mock POST requests due to NextRequest constructor issues
- **Impact**: POST endpoint testing blocked
- **Solution**: Need to create proper Request polyfill or use different mocking approach

### 2. Prisma Type Mocking
- **Problem**: TypeScript errors with Prisma mock methods
- **Impact**: Type safety warnings in tests
- **Solution**: Use explicit type casting `as jest.Mock` (implemented)

### 3. Coverage Threshold
- **Problem**: Current coverage (1.16%) far below target (70%)
- **Impact**: Coverage gates failing
- **Solution**: Gradually add tests, adjust thresholds during development
