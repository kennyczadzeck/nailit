# Google OAuth Authentication - Implementation Status

## ✅ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED & OPERATIONAL**

### 1. Authentication Infrastructure
- ✅ NextAuth.js with Google Provider configured and working
- ✅ Prisma schema updated with OAuth models (User, Account, Session, VerificationToken)
- ✅ Database migration completed successfully across all environments
- ✅ Custom sign-in page (`/auth/signin`) with Google OAuth flow
- ✅ Authentication error page (`/auth/error`) with detailed error handling
- ✅ Session provider wrapper for the entire app
- ✅ Middleware to protect routes requiring authentication

### 2. User Flow Implementation
- ✅ Welcome page (`/welcome`) updated for Google-only authentication
- ✅ Home page (`/`) redirects to welcome page for unauthenticated users
- ✅ Protected routes require authentication via middleware
- ✅ Project creation page (`/projects/create`) for required first-time setup
- ✅ Projects API updated to handle authenticated requests and project creation

### 3. Gmail Integration Setup
- ✅ Google OAuth configured with Gmail scopes:
  - `gmail.readonly` - Read Gmail messages and metadata
  - `gmail.send` - Send reply emails
- ✅ Auto-enable email monitoring when project is created
- ✅ Store contractor and team member emails for monitoring

### 4. **WORKING** Authentication Flow
1. User visits any protected route → redirected to `/auth/signin`
2. User clicks "Continue with Google" → Google OAuth consent
3. After successful OAuth → redirected to `/dashboard`
4. If no projects exist → redirected to `/projects/create` (blocking)
5. After project creation → access granted to dashboard and features
