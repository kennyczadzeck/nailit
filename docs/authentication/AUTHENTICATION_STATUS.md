# Google OAuth Authentication - Implementation Status

## ✅ Completed Implementation

### 1. Authentication Infrastructure
- ✅ NextAuth.js with Google Provider configured
- ✅ Prisma schema updated with OAuth models (User, Account, Session, VerificationToken)
- ✅ Database migration completed successfully
- ✅ Custom sign-in page (`/auth/signin`) with Google OAuth flow
- ✅ Authentication error page (`/auth/error`) with detailed error handling
- ✅ Session provider wrapper for the entire app
- ✅ Middleware to protect routes requiring authentication

### 2. User Flow Implementation
- ✅ Welcome page (`/welcome`) updated for Google-only authentication
- ✅ Home page (`/`) redirects to welcome page for unauthenticated users
- ✅ Protected routes require authentication via middleware
- ✅ Project creation page (`/projects/create`) for required first-time setup
- ✅ Projects API updated to handle authenticated requests and project creation

### 3. Gmail Integration Setup
- ✅ Google OAuth configured with Gmail scopes:
  - `gmail.readonly` - Read Gmail messages and metadata
  - `gmail.send` - Send reply emails
- ✅ Auto-enable email monitoring when project is created
- ✅ Store contractor and team member emails for monitoring

### 4. Authentication Flow
1. User visits any protected route → redirected to `/auth/signin`
2. User clicks "Continue with Google" → Google OAuth consent
3. After successful OAuth → redirected to `/dashboard`
4. If no projects exist → redirected to `/projects/create` (blocking)
5. After project creation → access granted to dashboard and features

## ⚠️ Required Setup Steps

### 1. Environment Variables
You need to create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"

# NextAuth.js
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-generated-secret-here"

# Google OAuth (Required)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="your-google-client-id"
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="your-google-client-secret"
```

### 2. Google Cloud Console Setup
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create/select a project
3. Enable Gmail API
4. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials:
   - Type: Web application
   - Authorized redirect URI: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google`
5. Copy Client ID and Client Secret to `.env`

### 3. Generate NextAuth Secret
```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

## 🧪 Testing the Implementation

### Current Status
- ✅ App is running on the development server
- ⚠️ Google OAuth credentials needed to test sign-in flow
- ✅ Database schema is ready
- ✅ All authentication pages are implemented

### Test Flow (After OAuth Setup)
1. Visit `http://localhost:3000` → redirects to welcome page
2. Click "Get Started with Google" → Google sign-in
3. Complete OAuth consent → redirected to dashboard
4. If first time → redirected to project creation
5. Fill project form → email monitoring auto-enabled
6. Access dashboard, flagged items, and timeline features

## 🔐 Security Features
- ✅ Route protection via Next.js middleware
- ✅ Server-side session validation
- ✅ Secure token storage in database
- ✅ Gmail scopes limited to read and send only
- ✅ Personal Gmail accounts only (no Google Workspace)

## 📧 Gmail Integration Notes
- OAuth success automatically grants Gmail access (no separate testing needed)
- Email monitoring is enabled based on contractor and team emails from project setup
- Access tokens are automatically refreshed by NextAuth.js
- No email validation required in MVP (OAuth proves Gmail access)

## 🚀 Next Steps
1. **Set up Google OAuth credentials** (required to test)
2. **Test the complete authentication flow**
3. **Verify project creation and email monitoring setup**
4. **Test dashboard access and navigation**

The authentication system is fully implemented and ready for testing once Google OAuth credentials are configured!
