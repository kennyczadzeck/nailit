# Docker Migration Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive Docker-based deployment migration plan to resolve the `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` environment variable embedding issue in the NailIt application.

## What Was Implemented

### âœ… Infrastructure Components

#### 1. ECR Stack (`infrastructure/lib/ecr-stack.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Manages Docker image repositories for each environment
- **Features**:
  - Separate repositories for dev/staging/prod
  - Image lifecycle policies (keep 10 images, delete untagged after 1 day)
  - Security scanning enabled
  - Proper tagging and outputs

#### 2. Updated App Runner Stack (`infrastructure/lib/app-runner-stack.ts`)
- **Dual Mode Support**: Can deploy in either `source` or `docker` mode
- **Context-Driven**: Uses CDK context `deploymentMode` to switch between modes
- **Enhanced IAM**: Added ECR permissions for Docker mode
- **Flexible Configuration**: Supports both legacy and new deployment methods

#### 3. Updated CDK App (`infrastructure/bin/nailit-app.ts`)
- **ECR Integration**: Added ECR stack deployment
- **Dependency Management**: Proper stack dependencies
- **Multi-Environment**: Supports all three environments

### âœ… Docker Configuration

#### 1. Enhanced Dockerfile
- **Build Arguments**: Accepts `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables as build args
- **Environment Variables**: Properly sets env vars for Next.js build
- **Multi-Stage Build**: Optimized for production deployment
- **Security**: Runs as non-root user

#### 2. GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/docker-build-deploy.yml`)
- **Matrix Strategy**: Builds for each environment based on branch
- **ECR Integration**: Builds and pushes Docker images
- **Build Arguments**: Passes `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables during build
- **Caching**: Uses GitHub Actions cache for faster builds
- **Auto-Deployment**: Triggers App Runner deployment after image push

### âœ… Deployment Scripts

#### 1. Docker Deployment (`infrastructure/scripts/deploy-docker.sh`)
- **Environment Validation**: Ensures valid environment selection
- **ECR First**: Deploys ECR stack before App Runner
- **Context Setting**: Sets `deploymentMode=docker`
- **Error Handling**: Proper exit codes and messaging

#### 2. Source Deployment (`infrastructure/scripts/deploy-source.sh`)
- **Legacy Support**: Maintains source code deployment option
- **Fallback**: Quick rollback option if Docker deployment fails
- **Context Setting**: Sets `deploymentMode=source`

#### 3. Package.json Scripts
- **Convenience Commands**: Easy deployment commands
- **Environment-Specific**: Separate commands for dev/staging/prod
- **Mode-Specific**: Both docker and source deployment options

### âœ… Documentation

- **Background**: Problem description and solution approach
- **Architecture**: Before/after deployment flow diagrams
- **Implementation**: Detailed component descriptions

## Key Features

### ðŸŽ¯ Solves the Core Problem
- **NEXT_PUBLIC Variables**: Guaranteed embedding in client bundle during Docker build
- **Build Reliability**: Consistent environment variable availability
- **Security**: Proper separation of build-time vs runtime secrets

### ðŸ”„ Maintains Compatibility
- **Dual Mode**: Can switch between Docker and source code deployment
- **Existing Workflow**: Maintains current development workflow
- **Rollback**: Quick fallback to previous deployment method

### ðŸš€ Enhances Operations
- **Faster Deployments**: Pre-built images deploy faster than source builds
- **Consistency**: Same image across environments
- **Caching**: Docker layer caching reduces build times
- **Monitoring**: Better visibility into build and deployment process

## Environment Variable Strategy

### Build-time (Embedded in Client Bundle)
```dockerfile
ARG NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY
ARG NEXT_PUBLIC_BUILD_TIME
ENV NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=$NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY
ENV NEXT_PUBLIC_BUILD_TIME=$NEXT_PUBLIC_BUILD_TIME
```

### Runtime (Server-side Only)
- `DATABASE_URL` (from AWS Secrets Manager)
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` (from AWS Secrets Manager)
- `NEXTAUTH_URL` (from AWS Secrets Manager)
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` (from AWS Secrets Manager)
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` (from AWS Secrets Manager)

## Deployment Flow

### New Docker-based Flow
```
1. Developer pushes to develop/staging/main branch
2. GitHub Actions triggers workflow
3. Workflow builds Docker image with NEXT_PUBLIC_* build args
4. Image pushed to ECR repository
5. App Runner deployment triggered
6. App Runner pulls image and starts new deployment
7. Environment variables embedded in client bundle work correctly
```

### Legacy Source-based Flow (Fallback)
```
1. Developer pushes to develop/staging/main branch
2. App Runner detects change via GitHub connection
3. App Runner builds application from source
4. Build command attempts to set NEXT_PUBLIC_* variables
5. Variables may not be properly embedded in client bundle
```

## Commands Reference

### Deployment
```bash
# Docker-based deployment
cd infrastructure
npm run deploy:docker:dev
npm run deploy:docker:staging
npm run deploy:docker:prod

# Source-based deployment (fallback)
npm run deploy:source:dev
npm run deploy:source:staging
npm run deploy:source:prod
```

### Manual CDK
```bash
# Deploy ECR repositories
cdk deploy ECR-dev --context environment=development
cdk deploy ECR-staging --context environment=staging
cdk deploy ECR-prod --context environment=production

# Deploy App Runner in Docker mode
cdk deploy AppRunner-dev --context environment=development --context deploymentMode=docker

# Deploy App Runner in source mode
cdk deploy AppRunner-dev --context environment=development --context deploymentMode=source
```

## Success Criteria

2. **App Runner stacks** support both deployment modes
3. **GitHub Actions workflow** builds and pushes Docker images
4. **Deployment scripts** work for all environments

2. **Google Maps address autocomplete** working in all environments
3. **Health endpoint** shows correct environment variables
4. **No environment variable errors** in browser console

## Next Steps

1. **Execute Migration**: Follow the quick start guide to implement
2. **Test Thoroughly**: Validate all environments work correctly
3. **Monitor**: Watch for any issues in the first 24-48 hours
4. **Document Lessons**: Update guides based on real implementation experience
5. **Team Training**: Ensure team understands new deployment process
