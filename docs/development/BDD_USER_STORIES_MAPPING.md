    expect(signIn).toHaveBeenCalledWith('google')
  })
})
```

#### **Login User Story** 
```
Description: Login
User Story: As a homeowner with a Nailit account who hasn't authenticated, I need to authenticate with Google as my identity provider so that I can gain access to Nailit.
Acceptance Criteria: Given that a homeowner does have an active Nailit session, when they click the login CTA, then they will need to login with Google. Given that homeowner does have an active Nailit session, when they navigate to Nailit, then they will be automatically redirected to their project dashboard.
```

**â†’ BDD Test Implementation:**
```javascript
describe('User Story: Login', () => {
  test('Given homeowner does have account but no active session, When they click login CTA, Then they login with Google', () => {
    // Maps to first acceptance criteria

```

**â†’ BDD Test Structure (Ready to Implement):**
```javascript
// tests/bdd/features/gmail-onboarding.test.tsx
describe('User Story: Connect Gmail', () => {
  test('Given signed up with Google, When start onboarding, Then prompted to authorize Gmail access', () => {
    // Test Gmail OAuth flow
  })
})
```

#### **Create First Project User Story**
```
Description: Create First Project  
User Story: As a homeowner, I need to create my first project with Nailit so that Nailit can start providing me with an audit log of my home renovation project.
Acceptance Criteria: Given that the homeowner has authorized their Gmail account, if Nailit receives an error in obtaining the access token from Google, then the user needs to retry authorizing their Gmail account. Given that the homeowner has authorized their Gmail account, when Nailit has received the access token from Google, then the user needs to move onto creating their first project.
```

### **5. Account Settings** ðŸ“‹ PENDING

#### **Homeowner Profile User Story**
```
Description: homeowner Profile / Info
User Story: As a homeowner, my profile name and avatar should be pulled from my linked Google Account so that my identity can be consistent across the way I communicate with my project teams.

// tests/bdd/features/user-profile.test.tsx
describe('User Story: User Profile', () => {
  test('Given connected Google account, When visit profile, Then see Google account data', () => {
    // Test profile data synchronization
  })
})
```

## ðŸš§ **Requires Infrastructure First**

### **6. Email Monitoring & AI Processing** ðŸ”® FUTURE

These user stories require Gmail integration and AI processing infrastructure:

- **Project Items**: AI classification of emails into cost/scope/schedule/decision
- **Unclassified Flagged Items**: Manual classification when AI confidence < 60%
- **Reclassify Flagged Items**: Learning from user corrections
- **Project Timeline**: Confirmed flagged items timeline
- **Export Functionality**: CSV/PDF exports

**Example Future BDD Test:**
```javascript
// tests/bdd/features/email-monitoring.test.tsx
describe('User Story: Project Items', () => {
  test('Given email sent to team, When AI processes message, Then creates flagged item with category', () => {
    // Test AI email classification
  })
})
```
