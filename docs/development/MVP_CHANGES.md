# MVP Alignment Changes

## Overview
Updated NailIt to strictly follow the MVP user stories by removing milestone functionality and focusing on the core email → flagged item → timeline workflow.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Updates (`prisma/schema.prisma`)
- **Removed**: `MILESTONE` from `TimelineCategory` enum
- **Kept**: `COST`, `SCHEDULE`, `SCOPE`, `ISSUE`, `UPDATE` categories
- **Rationale**: Milestones weren't part of the original user stories

### 2. Seed Data Updates (`prisma/seed.ts`)
- **Removed**: All pre-existing timeline entries including:
  - "Project Kickoff" milestone
  - "Demolition Complete" milestone 
  - "Electrical Upgrade" standalone entry
- **Kept**: All flagged items from email detection
- **Rationale**: Timeline should only populate from confirmed flagged items

### 3. Frontend Component Updates (`app/components/Timeline.tsx`)
- **Removed**: Milestone category handling:
  - Milestone icon mapping (`FlagIcon`)
  - Milestone color scheme (green)
  - Milestone category label
- **Kept**: All other category types (cost, schedule, scope, issue, update)

### 4. Documentation Updates
- **Updated**: `TIMELINE_INTEGRATION.md` to reflect MVP-focused approach
- **Created**: This `MVP_CHANGES.md` file to document changes
- **Emphasized**: Email-centric workflow without manual milestone tracking

## Result: Pure MVP Implementation

### Before (Feature Creep)
- Timeline had pre-existing milestone entries
- Mixed manual entries with email-originated entries
- Milestone category supported throughout UI
- Confusion about what belonged in timeline

### After (MVP-Focused)
- Timeline starts empty
- Only populated by confirmed flagged items
- All timeline entries trace back to email sources
- Clear workflow: Email → Flag → Review → Timeline

## User Story Alignment

✅ **AS A** project owner  
✅ **I WANT** to receive alerts when project emails indicate potential schedule, cost, or scope changes  
✅ **SO THAT** I can review and address these changes proactively

✅ **AS A** project owner  
✅ **I WANT** to confirm or dismiss flagged email impacts  
✅ **SO THAT** I can build an accurate timeline of verified project changes

✅ **AS A** project owner  
✅ **I WANT** to see a chronological timeline of confirmed project impacts  
✅ **SO THAT** I can understand the evolution of my project

## Testing the Changes

1. **Empty Timeline**: Visit `/timeline` - should show empty state initially
2. **Review Flagged Items**: Visit `/flagged` - see email-detected items awaiting review
3. **Confirm Items**: Confirm flagged items to populate timeline
4. **Verify Workflow**: Timeline entries only appear after confirmation

## Database Reset Required
After changes, run:
```bash
npm run db:reset
```

This ensures clean data aligned with MVP scope.
