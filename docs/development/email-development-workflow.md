# Email Ingestion Development Workflow

## ðŸŽ¯ **Development Philosophy**

### **Core Principles**
- **Feature-Branch Development**: Each phase gets its own feature branch from `develop`
- **Test-Driven Development**: BDD tests written before implementation
- **Incremental Deployment**: Each phase deployed to staging for validation
- **Risk Mitigation**: Never break existing functionality

---

## ðŸŒ³ **Git Branching Strategy**

### **Branch Structure**
```
main (production)
â”œâ”€â”€ develop (integration)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ feature/email-phase-1-foundation
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ feature/email-phase-2-ai-analysis  
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ feature/email-phase-3-project-association
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ feature/email-phase-4-dashboard-integration
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ feature/email-phase-5-multi-provider
â””â”€â”€ hotfix/* (emergency fixes)
```

### **Phase-Based Development Flow**

#### **Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-3)**
```bash
# Create feature branch from develop
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/email-phase-1-foundation

# Development workflow
git add .
git commit -m "feat(email): implement Gmail OAuth flow"
git push origin feature/email-phase-1-foundation

# Create PR: feature/email-phase-1-foundation â†’ develop
# After review & tests pass â†’ merge to develop
# Deploy develop to staging for validation
# After validation â†’ merge develop to main
# Deploy main to production
```

#### **Branch Naming Convention**
- `feature/email-phase-{number}-{description}`
- `feature/email-oauth-gmail-integration`
- `feature/email-ai-analysis-engine`
- `feature/email-dashboard-timeline`
- `hotfix/email-webhook-security-fix`

## ðŸ§ª **Testing Workflow**

### **Test-Driven Development Process**

#### **1. Write BDD Tests First**
```gherkin
# tests/bdd/features/email-oauth.feature
Feature: Gmail OAuth Integration
  As a project manager
  I want to connect my Gmail account
  So that NailIt can monitor my project emails

Scenario: Successful Gmail Connection
  Given I am logged into NailIt
  When I click "Connect Gmail"
  And I complete the Google OAuth flow
  Then my Gmail account is connected
  And I see "Connected" status in settings
```

#### **2. Implement Feature to Pass Tests**
```typescript
// Implement minimum code to make tests pass
// Focus on the specific acceptance criteria
// Don't over-engineer the solution
```

#### **3. Refactor and Optimize**
```typescript
// Clean up code after tests pass
// Optimize performance if needed
// Add error handling and edge cases
```

### **Testing Commands**

#### **Development Testing**
```bash
# Run all tests for specific feature
npm run test:feature email-oauth

# Run specific test file
npm run test tests/email/oauth.test.ts

# Run tests in watch mode during development
npm run test:watch

# Run BDD tests for current feature
npm run test:bdd features/email-oauth.feature
```

#### **Pre-Commit Testing**
```bash
# Run before committing
npm run test:pre-commit

# This runs:
# - Unit tests for changed files
# - Integration tests for affected modules
# - Linting and type checking
# - BDD tests for modified features
```

#### **Pre-Merge Testing**
```bash
# Run before merging PR
npm run test:full

# This runs:
# - All unit tests
# - All integration tests  
# - All BDD tests
# - Performance tests
# - Security tests
```

### **Test Coverage Requirements**

#### **Minimum Coverage Thresholds**
```json
{
  "coverageThreshold": {
    "global": {
      "branches": 80,
      "functions": 85,
      "lines": 85,
      "statements": 85
    },
    "src/lib/email/": {
      "branches": 90,
      "functions": 95,
      "lines": 95,
      "statements": 95
    }
  }
}
```

## ðŸš€ **Deployment Pipeline**

### **Environment Progression**

#### **Development â†’ Staging â†’ Production**
```bash
# 1. Development (local)
npm run dev
# Test all functionality locally
# Run full test suite

# 2. Staging (feature branch)
git push origin feature/email-phase-1-foundation
# Automatic deployment to staging environment
# Run integration tests against staging
# Manual QA testing

# 3. Production (main branch)
git checkout develop
git merge feature/email-phase-1-foundation
git push origin develop
# Deploy develop to staging for final validation

git checkout main  
git merge develop
git push origin main
# Deploy to production with monitoring
```

### **Automated Deployment Checks**

#### **Pre-Deployment Validation**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/email-feature-deployment.yml
name: Email Feature Deployment

on:
  push:
    branches: [feature/email-*]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:

        run: npm run test:unit
      
      - name: Run Integration Tests
        run: npm run test:integration
        
      - name: Run BDD Tests
        run: npm run test:bdd
        
      - name: Check Coverage
        run: npm run test:coverage
        
      - name: Security Scan
        run: npm run security:scan

  deploy-staging:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/heads/feature/email-')
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to Staging
        run: |
          # Deploy feature branch to staging environment
          # Run smoke tests against staging
          # Notify team of deployment
```

#### **Post-Deployment Monitoring**
```bash
# Health checks after deployment
curl -f https://staging.nailit.app/api/health/email
curl -f https://staging.nailit.app/api/email/providers

# Monitor key metrics
# - API response times
# - Error rates  
# - Queue processing times
# - AI analysis accuracy
```

### **Rollback Strategy**

#### **Automatic Rollback Triggers**
- Error rate >5% for 5 minutes
- API response time >10 seconds
- Database connection failures
- Critical security alerts

#### **Manual Rollback Process**
```bash
# Immediate rollback to previous version
git revert HEAD --no-edit
git push origin main

# Or rollback to specific commit
git reset --hard <previous-commit>
git push --force-with-lease origin main

# Restore database if needed
# Notify team and stakeholders
```
