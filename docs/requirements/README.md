1. **Epic Definition** - High-level feature description
2. **User Stories** - Individual user-focused requirements
3. **Acceptance Criteria** - Given-When-Then scenarios
4. **Implementation** - Feature branch development
5. **Validation** - BDD test implementation
6. **Review** - Pull request validation
