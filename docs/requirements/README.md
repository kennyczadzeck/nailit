## Email Ingestion Feature Overview

### **Vision**
Automatically capture, analyze, and organize all project-related communications to provide comprehensive visibility into construction project status and extract actionable insights.

### **Core Capabilities**
- **Real-time Email Ingestion**: Gmail/Outlook integration with webhook-based processing
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: OpenAI-driven relevance scoring, classification, and entity extraction
- **Project Association**: Automatic email-to-project mapping with confidence scoring
- **Intelligent Alerting**: Context-aware notifications for urgent communications
- **Dashboard Integration**: Seamless timeline views and search capabilities

### **Development Phases**
1. **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-3)**: Foundation Infrastructure - OAuth, webhooks, basic ingestion
2. **Phase 2 (Weeks 4-6)**: AI Analysis Engine - Relevance scoring, classification, entity extraction
3. **Phase 3 (Weeks 7-8)**: Project Association - Automatic email-to-project mapping
4. **Phase 4 (Weeks 9-10)**: Dashboard Integration - Timeline views, search, filtering
5. **Phase 5 (Weeks 11-13)**: Advanced Features - Multi-provider support, notifications

### **Success Metrics**
- **Performance**: Email processing within 30 seconds
- **Accuracy**: >90% relevance scoring, >85% classification accuracy
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime with zero data loss
- **User Adoption**: 80% of users actively using email monitoring within 30 days

## Requirements Process

All features should follow the BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) process outlined in the [Feature Development Playbook](../development/FEATURE_DEVELOPMENT_PLAYBOOK.md):

1. **Epic Definition** - High-level feature description
2. **User Stories** - Individual user-focused requirements
3. **Acceptance Criteria** - Given-When-Then scenarios
4. **Implementation** - Feature branch development
5. **Validation** - BDD test implementation
6. **Review** - Pull request validation
