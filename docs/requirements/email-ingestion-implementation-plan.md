## 🏗️ **Architecture Foundation**

### **Building on Existing Infrastructure**
Our enhancement leverages the robust foundation already in place:

```typescript
// Current Foundation (Already Implemented)
- Authentication: Google OAuth with gmail.readonly scope
- Flagged Items: AI-powered change detection and categorization
- Project Management: User/Project models with team member contacts
- Email Settings: Project-based email monitoring configuration
- Timeline System: Confirmed changes display in project timeline

// Existing Infrastructure (Already Deployed)
- S3 Buckets: nailit-{env}-emails-{account}
- SQS Queues: nailit-{env}-email-queue, nailit-{env}-ai-queue
- Database: Neon PostgreSQL with User/Project/FlaggedItem models
- CDK Infrastructure: Comprehensive AWS setup with IAM roles
```

### **New Components to Add**
```typescript
// Enhanced Database Schema
model EmailMessage {
  // Extends existing email monitoring with full content storage
  // Integrates with existing FlaggedItem system
  // Links to existing Project and User models
}

model EmailProvider {
  // Multi-provider support (Gmail + Outlook)
  // Enhanced OAuth token management
  // Per-project email monitoring settings
}

## 🧪 **Behavior-Driven Testing Strategy**

### **Homeowner-Focused BDD Tests**
Building on the existing BDD test structure in the codebase:

```gherkin
Feature: Enhanced Email Processing for Homeowners
  As a homeowner managing my renovation project
  I want comprehensive email processing and analysis
  So that I never miss important project communications

Background:
  Given I am a homeowner with an active renovation project
  And I have team members with known email addresses
  And I have existing flagged items from previous communications

Scenario: Enhanced Gmail Connection
  Given I want to monitor my renovation project emails
  When I click "Connect Gmail" in my project settings
  And I complete the enhanced Google OAuth flow
  Then my Gmail account is connected with real-time monitoring
  And I see "Email Monitoring: Active" status in my project
  And real-time email capture begins for project communications

Scenario: Automatic Project Email Detection
  Given my Gmail is connected to my kitchen renovation project
  When my contractor sends an email about cabinet installation delays
  Then the email is captured within 30 seconds
  And assigned to my kitchen renovation project automatically
  And categorized as "Schedule Update"
  And appears in my project's communication timeline

Scenario: Email-Based Change Detection
  Given I receive an email from my contractor
  And the email contains "The flooring will cost an additional $2,000 due to subfloor issues"
  When AI processes the email
  Then a flagged item is created with category "COST"
  And the impact is recorded as "+$2,000"
  And the flagged item description includes "subfloor issues"
  And the flagged item links to the original email
  And I receive a notification about the change

Scenario: Unified Communication Timeline
  Given I have email history and existing flagged items
  When I view my project's communications timeline
  Then I see emails and confirmed changes integrated chronologically
  And can search across both emails and flagged items
  And can click from emails to related flagged items
  And see the complete evolution of my project

Scenario: Multi-Project Email Assignment
  Given I have both a kitchen renovation and bathroom remodel project
  When I receive an email from my contractor about kitchen cabinets
  Then the email is automatically assigned to my kitchen renovation project
  And appears only in that project's communication timeline
  And does not appear in my bathroom remodel communications
```
