## ðŸ§ª **Behavior-Driven Test Strategy**

### **Test Framework Structure**
```gherkin
Feature: Enhanced Email Processing for Homeowners
  As a homeowner managing my renovation project
  I want comprehensive email processing and analysis
  So that I never miss important project communications

Background:
  Given I am a homeowner with an active renovation project
  And I have team members with known email addresses

Scenario: Gmail Connection for Project Monitoring
  Given I want to monitor my renovation project emails
  When I click "Connect Gmail" in my project settings
  And I complete the Google OAuth flow
  Then my Gmail account is connected to my project
  And I see "Email Monitoring: Active" status
  And real-time email capture begins

Scenario: Automatic Project Email Detection
  Given my Gmail is connected to my kitchen renovation project
  When my contractor sends an email about cabinet installation
  Then the email is captured within 30 seconds
  And assigned to my kitchen renovation project
  And categorized as "General Communication"
  And appears in my project's communication timeline

Scenario: Change Detection from Email
  Given I receive an email from my contractor
  And the email contains "The flooring will cost an additional $2,000"
  When AI processes the email
  Then a flagged item is created with category "COST"
  And the impact is recorded as "+$2,000"
  And the flagged item links to the original email
  And I receive a notification about the change

Scenario: Unified Communication Timeline
  Given I have email history and confirmed flagged items
  When I view my project's communications timeline
  Then I see emails and changes integrated chronologically
  And can search across both emails and flagged items
  And can jump between related emails and changes
  And see the complete story of my project evolution
```

### **Integration Test Categories**
1. **Email Connection Tests** - OAuth flow, real-time capture, security
2. **AI Analysis Tests** - Relevance detection, categorization, extraction accuracy
3. **Project Integration Tests** - Assignment logic, flagged item creation, timeline integration
4. **Dashboard Integration Tests** - Timeline view, search functionality, performance
5. **Multi-Provider Tests** - Gmail + Outlook integration, unified processing
6. **User Experience Tests** - End-to-end homeowner workflows, notification system

This revised plan maintains focus on the homeowner persona while building on your existing email monitoring and flagged items foundation, creating a comprehensive communication tracking system for renovation projects.
