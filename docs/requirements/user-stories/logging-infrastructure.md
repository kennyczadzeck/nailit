# User Story: Production-Ready Logging Infrastructure

## Epic
As a **development team**, we need comprehensive logging infrastructure so that we can monitor, debug, and maintain our application effectively in production.

## User Stories

### Story 1: Structured Logging System
**As a** developer  
**I want** a structured logging system with consistent JSON output  
**So that** I can easily search, filter, and analyze logs in production

#### Acceptance Criteria
```gherkin
Given I am implementing application functionality
When I use the logging system
Then logs should be output in structured JSON format with consistent fields
And logs should include metadata like timestamps, environment, service info
And logs should support different severity levels (error, warn, info, debug)
And logs should automatically include stack traces for errors
```

### Story 2: Request Tracing
**As a** developer  
**I want** automatic request tracing with unique IDs  
**So that** I can track requests across the entire application lifecycle

#### Acceptance Criteria
```gherkin
Given a user makes an API request
When the request is processed
Then a unique request ID should be generated
And the request ID should be included in all related log entries
And the request ID should be returned in response headers
And I should be able to trace the complete request flow using the ID
```

### Story 3: Performance Monitoring
**As a** developer  
**I want** automatic performance tracking for API requests and operations  
**So that** I can identify bottlenecks and optimize application performance

#### Acceptance Criteria
```gherkin
Given I am making API calls or database operations
When the operation completes
Then the duration should be automatically logged
And performance metrics should include start time, end time, and duration
And I should be able to identify slow operations from the logs
And performance data should be structured for analysis
```

### Story 4: Security Auditing
**As a** security-conscious developer  
**I want** comprehensive security event logging  
**So that** I can track authentication events and security incidents

#### Acceptance Criteria
```gherkin
Given users are authenticating or performing sensitive operations
When security events occur
Then authentication events should be logged (login, logout, failures)
And security violations should be logged with appropriate severity
And sensitive data should be automatically redacted from logs
And audit trails should be maintained for compliance
```

### Story 5: Environment-Aware Configuration
**As a** developer  
**I want** different logging behavior in different environments  
**So that** I have detailed logs in development and optimized logs in production

#### Acceptance Criteria
```gherkin
Given the application is running in different environments
When logs are generated
Then development should use debug level with pretty console output
And production should use info level with JSON output to files
And staging should use debug level with JSON output and file logging
And CloudWatch integration should only be active in staging/production
```

### Story 6: CloudWatch Integration
**As a** DevOps engineer  
**I want** automatic log aggregation in AWS CloudWatch  
**So that** I can monitor production applications and set up alerts

#### Acceptance Criteria
```gherkin
Given the application is running in AWS environments
When error-level events occur
Then logs should be automatically sent to CloudWatch Logs
And logs should be organized by environment in separate log groups
And log streams should be organized by date and instance
And I should be able to query logs using CloudWatch Insights
```

### Story 7: Data Sanitization
**As a** security-conscious developer  
**I want** automatic sanitization of sensitive data in logs  
**So that** passwords and tokens are never exposed in log files

#### Acceptance Criteria
```gherkin
Given I am logging data that may contain sensitive information
When logs are written
Then passwords should be automatically redacted as '[REDACTED]'
And API tokens should be automatically redacted as '[REDACTED]'
And credit card numbers should be automatically redacted
And manual sanitization methods should be available for custom data
```

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All user stories have passing BDD tests
- [ ] Winston logging library integrated with TypeScript types
- [ ] Request tracing middleware implemented and tested
- [ ] Environment-specific configuration working
- [ ] CloudWatch integration functional in staging/production
- [ ] Data sanitization working for sensitive fields
- [ ] Performance monitoring capturing durations
- [ ] Security audit logging implemented
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation created
- [ ] Migration guide from console.log created
- [ ] No console.log statements remain in production code
- [ ] All tests passing including new logging tests
- [ ] Code quality checks passing
- [ ] TypeScript compilation successful

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual logging methods and sanitization
2. **Integration Tests**: Test request tracing and CloudWatch integration
3. **BDD Tests**: Verify all acceptance criteria are met
4. **Performance Tests**: Ensure logging doesn't impact application performance
5. **Security Tests**: Verify sensitive data is properly redacted

## Implementation Notes

- Use Winston library for structured logging
- Implement singleton pattern for logger instance
- Use UUID for request ID generation
- Integrate with AWS SDK for CloudWatch
- Follow environment-specific configuration patterns
- Maintain backward compatibility during migration
