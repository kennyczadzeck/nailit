└── helpers/                    # Enhanced testing utilities
```

#### **BDD Test Pattern**
```javascript
/**
 * Feature: [Feature Name]
 * User Story: [Exact user story from MVP requirements]
 * 
 * As a [user type]
 * I want [functionality] 
 * So that [benefit]
 */
describe('User Story: [Story Name]', () => {
  test('Given [condition], When [action], Then [expected outcome]', () => {
    // Given: Setup test conditions
    // When: Execute user action
    // Then: Verify expected behavior
  })
})
```
