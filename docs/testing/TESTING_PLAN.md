### 🏗️ **BDD Test Structure**

Each user story maps to test files following this pattern:
```javascript
/**
 * Feature: [Feature Name]
 * User Story: [Exact user story from MVP requirements]
 * 
 * As a [user type]
 * I want [functionality] 
 * So that [benefit]
 */
describe('User Story: [Story Name]', () => {
  test('Given [condition], When [action], Then [expected outcome]', () => {
    // Given: Setup test conditions
    // When: Execute user action
    // Then: Verify expected behavior
  })
})
```

### 📁 **Directory Structure**
```

## 🔧 **Known Issues & Status**

### 1. Project Creation Text Assertion ⚠️ MINOR
- **Issue**: One test failing on text search for "reflects the project's scope"
- **Impact**: 5/6 project creation tests passing
- **Priority**: Low (test logic issue, not functionality issue)

### 2. NextRequest Mocking 📋 DOCUMENTED
- **Issue**: Cannot mock POST requests due to NextRequest constructor
- **Impact**: POST endpoint testing blocked
- **Workaround**: Focus on GET endpoints and UI testing first

### 3. TypeScript Linter Warnings 🔧 COSMETIC
- **Issue**: `toBeInTheDocument` matcher TypeScript warnings
- **Impact**: Editor warnings only, tests pass correctly
- **Status**: Functional, cosmetic linting issue

## 🗂️ **Centralized Test Fixtures** ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**Problem**: Test data was scattered inline throughout tests, making maintenance difficult.

**Solution**: Comprehensive centralized fixture system.

### **Fixture Organization**

```
tests/fixtures/
├── index.ts              # Main export - import everything from here
├── users.ts              # User data & authentication scenarios  
├── projects.ts           # Project data & user scenarios
├── api-responses.ts      # HTTP response mocks
├── README.md            # Complete usage documentation
└── fixtures.test.ts     # Validation tests (11/11 passing ✅)
```

### **Key Benefits**

- **Consistency**: Same test data across all test types
- **Maintainability**: Update data in one place
- **BDD-Friendly**: Named scenarios match user stories
- **Self-Documenting**: Descriptive fixture names
- **Type-Safe**: Full TypeScript support

### **Usage Examples**

```typescript
// BDD Test with Fixtures
import { testUsers, testProjects, givenDatabaseHas } from '../../fixtures'

test('Given user has projects, When viewing dashboard, Then sees project list', () => {
  // Given: using centralized fixtures
  givenDatabaseHas.projects([testProjects.kitchenReno, testProjects.bathroomRemodel])
  
  // When & Then: clean, readable test code
  render(<Dashboard user={testUsers.john} />)
  expect(screen.getByText(testProjects.kitchenReno.name)).toBeInTheDocument()
})
```

### **Available Fixtures**

| Fixture Type | Examples | Usage |
|-------------|----------|--------|
| **Users** | `testUsers.john`, `testUsers.jane` | Authentication, ownership scenarios |
| **Projects** | `testProjects.kitchenReno`, `projectScenarios.userWithProjects` | Project data, user scenarios |
| **API Responses** | `successResponses.projectsList`, `errorResponses.unauthorized` | HTTP mocking |
| **Database Mocks** | `givenDatabaseHas.projects()`, `setupPrismaMocks.reset()` | Prisma mocking |
