    body: `Hi Sarah,

I wanted to give you a heads up about the kitchen renovation. During demolition, we discovered some unexpected plumbing issues behind the sink wall that need to be addressed.

The additional plumbing work will cost an extra $2,800 and add 3 days to our timeline. This includes:
- Replacing corroded pipes ($1,200)
- Updating to code compliance ($900) 
- Additional labor ($700)

I can show you the damage tomorrow if you'd like to see it before we proceed.

Best,

    body: `Hi Sarah,

Unfortunately, the custom tiles you ordered are delayed by 2 weeks due to shipping issues. This will push back our completion date from March 15th to March 29th.

We can either:
1. Wait for your tiles (recommended)
2. Use similar tiles from local supplier (+$300)

Let me know how you'd like to proceed.

Mike`

The oak flooring you selected is currently backordered. I found a very similar maple option that's in stock and actually $500 less expensive.

Attached are photos and specs for your review. Quality is comparable and installation timeline stays the same.

Let me know if this works for you.

Best,
Mike`,

We have a water leak in the kitchen that needs immediate attention. I've shut off the main water valve as a precaution.

This was caused by the old pipe we discussed yesterday. We need to fix this before we can continue with any other work.

Please call me ASAP at (555) 123-4567.

Please find attached the invoice for this week's work on your kitchen renovation.

Work completed:
- Demolition of old cabinets
- Electrical rough-in
- Plumbing rough-in

Total: $3,500.00

Payment due within 30 days.

Thanks,

    body: `Hi Mike,

Thanks for letting me know about the plumbing issues. I'd definitely like to see the damage tomorrow - how about 2 PM?

The additional $2,800 is within our contingency budget, so please go ahead with the work. Better to fix it properly now than have problems later.

Will this affect any other parts of the timeline besides the 3 days you mentioned?

Thanks,
Sarah`

A 2-week delay is really concerning since we have family visiting March 30th. 

Can you tell me more about the local supplier option? I'm willing to consider it if the quality is close. Can you send me photos/samples to compare?

Also, if we go with the local tiles, would that actually get us back on the original March 15th timeline?

Let's discuss options,
Sarah`

  'homeowner-material-questions': {
    subject: 'Re: Flooring Material Substitution',
    body: `Hi Mike,

The maple flooring looks good in the photos - thanks for finding an alternative! I have a few questions:

1. Is the warranty the same as the oak flooring?
2. Will it match the existing wood trim in the living room?
3. Can I get a small sample to see it in person?

The $500 savings is nice, but I want to make sure it's the right choice long-term.

Let me know when I can see a sample.

Just saw your message - yes, please go ahead and do whatever you need to fix the water leak immediately. I trust your judgment.

I'm at work but can be there by 4 PM if you need me to see anything or sign off on additional work.

Thanks for catching this quickly!

Thanks for the invoice. I have a quick question about the electrical rough-in cost - it seems higher than the original estimate. Can you help me understand what was different?

Also, I noticed some dust got on the dining room furniture. Can your team cover furniture in the adjacent rooms going forward?

Payment will be sent by Friday.

Best,
Sarah`

Hope the week is going well! I wanted to check on progress since I've been traveling.

How are we tracking against the timeline? Any issues or changes I should know about?

Also, when would be a good time to discuss the cabinet hardware selection? I have some ideas but want to make sure the timing works with your schedule.

Thanks,
Sarah`
